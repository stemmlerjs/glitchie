## Setup

       src folder to your project's src folder.
2. Run the program via the entry point in *GuiAndListener.java* via the *gui* package.

OR

1. Run the *glitchpond.jar* file

## How to Use
- Open a picture to glitch by clicking File > Open
- Specify a glitch rate to glitch the photo

  > This is the number of iterations the glitch algorithm will be run (so take it easy! -- pictures break)
  
- Use the Undo / Redo buttons to get a glitch effect that you like
- Save the glitch by clicking File > Save
